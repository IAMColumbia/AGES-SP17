Hello! Thank you for taking an interest in my music! 
I hope you find this pack useful for your projects. 
As a game dev myself I know how important sound can be to a game. 
While this download is free, 
and by Unity terms is in fact *royalty* free as well,
 it would mean a lot if you would do one of the following: 

Link people to my Soundcloud and or Bandcamp! 
All my music is pay what you want, 
so if you use it in your work and people actually like what they hear,
 you can link them to one of the following: 

Soundcloud: soundcloud.com/no-audible-dialogue

BandCamp: noaudibledialogue.bandcamp.com/

If you really enjoyed the music more than I might have imagined, 
it would mean the world to me if you gave me a shoutout somewhere in the credits of your game. 
Be it in the game itself or simply in a description of a trailer on YouTube.
 But of course this is not neccarry. 

Really all I ask is if someone asks you where the music is from,
 tell them to Google “No Audible Dialogue”.

Anyway I hope you enjoy the tunes and find some good use for them! 
If you need any slight tweaks made or maybe want the multitracks or something,
 feel free to reach out through my website: noaudibledialogue.audio and get in touch. 

Take care and maybe I’ll see you around the forums!
